            <h3>In this <a href="https://chi2024.acm.org/">CHI 2024</a> hybrid panel, we aim to start a much-needed conversation about PhD advising to raise awareness within <a href="https://sigchi.org/">SIGCHI</a> about common advising problems; and to begin brainstorming solutions that faculty, administrators, and PhD students can implement.</h3>

            Advisor-advisee relationships between PhD students and faculty are vital to research, but advising dynamics can be challenging for both student and advisor. Though advising can involve egregious problems such as sexual harassment, we focus on what might be <b>less serious but more common issues such as exploitation, unprofessional behavior, mishandling of credit, and inadequate communication</b>. While problems can be caused by advisor or advisee, the power imbalance exacerbates problems for PhD students. In any case, open discussion about PhD advising is rare. Our panel aims to address this gap. <a href="https://imjane.net/papers/chi2024-improving-advising.pdf" target="_blank">Read more here.</a>

                Our panel aims to start conversations around the following questions:
                <ul>
                    <li>What are some common patterns of problems in advising
                relationships? Crimes and blatant abuse are important to
                address, of course, but often they are understood as general
                phenomena. What are subtler problems that may benefit
                from more visibility?</li>
                    <li>When do academia’s incentives not support good advising?</li>
                    <li>How can we make incentives compatible with good advising?</li>
                    <li>What can students, faculty, and administrators concretely
                do to improve advising relationships? For example...</li>
                    <ul>
                       <li>What institutional changes would reduce the incidence of advising problems?</li>
                        <li>What would enable PhD students to be more proactive in reporting problems and/or seeking help?</li>
                        <li>What kinds of mechanisms would enable faculty – especially tenured faculty – to be held accountable (especially for problems that do not rise to the level of a prosecutable offense)?</li>
                        <li>How can expectations between students and faculty be better negotiated?</li>
                    </ul>
